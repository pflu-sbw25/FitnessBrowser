See SETUP for instructions on the files and perl utilities that are
required for this to work. The key directories are:
cgi/ -- CGI scripts
cgi_data/ -- sqlite3 database and BLAST database
tmp/ -- temporary files
lib/Utils.pm -- shared functions

Site map:

myFrontPage.cgi -- the front page
	search by name => myFitShow.cgi
	search by sequence => mySeqSearch.cgi
myFitShow.cgi -- show list of matching genes, or fitness data for one
	if a list, links to page for individual gene
	show all => showAll=1 option
	homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	cofitness => cofit.cgi
	data cells link to exp.cgi
cofit.cgi -- top cofit hits for a gene
	=> myFitShow.cgi or mySeqSearch.cgi
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show
	description
	quality metrics
	specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes (linking to myFitShow.cgi)

And every page ends with a link to the front page
