Site map:

# top nav bar
	find gene => geneSearch.cgi => myFitShow.cgi
	BLAST => blastSearch.cgi  => mySeqSearch.cgi
	Organisms => orgAll.cgi => org.cgi
	Experiment => expSearch.cgi => exps.cgi (search), or cond.cgi (for all C/N/stress)
# gene-wise tabs
Gene => geneOverview.cgi
Fitness => myFitShow.cgi (1 gene mode)
Nearby => genesFit.cgi (around mode)
Cofitness => cofit.cgi
Protein => domains.cgi
Homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi (gene query mode)
# gene-wise pages
myFitShow.cgi -- show list of matching genes, or table of fitness data for one gene
	if a list, links to page for individual gene and genome
	if showing table of fitness data (either top phenotypes or all data):
		title => org.cgi
		each experiment => exp.cgi
		each cell => orthFit.cgi
		add a gene => genesFit.cgi
	and also links to compare (to genesFit.cgi) or to change top vs. all
cofit.cgi -- top cofit hits for a gene
	each hit => myFitShow.cgi
	checkboxes => genesFit.cgi
orthFit.cgi -- for a gene in a condition, show table of fitness across orthologs
	each gene => showFit.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	show all homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi
genesFit.cgi -- show fitness of multiple genes
	each individual gene => myFitShow.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	add or remove genes => locusId or addgene options
	show all => showAll=1 option
# experiment tabs -- they all link to exp.cgi
Overview => all the metadata (default)
Specific => specific phenotypes (show=specific)
- Genes => show=important
+ Genes => show=detrimental
Metrics => show=quality
# experiment-wise pages
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show metrics, or top genes
	if showing specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes
		each gene => myFitShow.cgi, each cell => orthFit.cgi
	compare to => compareExps.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi [will this be on all tabs?]
exps.cgi -- matching experiments => exp.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi (if a condition query was made)
	If showing all experiments for an organism, uses org.cgi to show the organism instead
compareExps.cgi -- interactive scatterplot to compare two experiments
	links to exp.cgi
	link to itself to change which experiments to show
	can interactively or programmatically build a gene table
		link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or genesFit.cgi for multi-gene heatmap
# other pages
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of BLAST hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
org.cgi -- overview page for an organism with #experiments of each type and data download.
orgAll.cgi -- overview of organisms with links to org.cgi, exps.cgi
# condition-wise pages
cond.cgi -- list all conditions in a group
	links to exps.cgi and orthCond.cgi for each condition
orthCond.cgi -- specific sick genes for a condition across all organisms
	link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or exp.cgi per experiment
	link to orthFit.cgi to compare a cell

Dead pages:
getSeq.cgi -- sequence of gene (if it is a protein)
