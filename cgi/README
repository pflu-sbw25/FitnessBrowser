See SETUP for instructions on the files and perl utilities that are
required for this to work. The key directories are:
cgi/ -- CGI scripts
cgi_data/ -- sqlite3 database and BLAST database
tmp/ -- temporary files
lib/Utils.pm -- shared functions

Site map:

myFrontPage.cgi -- the front page
	search by name => myFitShow.cgi
	search by sequence => mySeqSearch.cgi
myFitShow.cgi -- show list of matching genes, or table of fitness data for one gene
	if a list, links to page for individual gene
	if showing table of fitness data:
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	add a gene => genesFit.cgi
	show all => showAll=1 option
	show nearby => genesFit.cgi with around
	check homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	cofitness => cofit.cgi
genesFit.cgi -- show fitness of multiple genes
	each individual gene => myFitShow.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	add or remove genes => locusId or addgene options
	show all => showAll=1 option
cofit.cgi -- top cofit hits for a gene
	each hit => myFitShow.cgi
	checkboxes => genesFit.cgi
	fitness data (for query gene) => myFitShow.cgi
	homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show
	description
	quality metrics
	if showing specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes
		each gene => myFitShow.cgi

And every page ends with a link to the front page
