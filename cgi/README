	genesFit.cgi (of the same two genes)
	=> itself (change which comparison to show)
	=> itself to select which of multiple matching genes to compare to
        in dynamic table, fitness values => strainTable.cgi
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
	also each organism links to org.cgi
# experiment-wise pages
exps.cgi -- matching experiments => exp.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi (if a condition query was made)
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show metrics, or top genes
	if showing specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes

	compare to => compareExps.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi
compareExps.cgi -- interactive scatterplot to compare two experiments
	links to exp.cgi
	link to itself to change which experiments to show
	can interactively or programmatically build a gene table
		link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or genesFit.cgi for multi-gene heatmap
        in dynamic table, fitness values => strainTable.cgi
# condition-wise pages
cond.cgi -- list all conditions in a group
	links to exps.cgi and orthCond.cgi for each condition
orthCond.cgi -- specific sick genes for a condition across all organisms
	link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or exp.cgi per experiment
