Only the cgi scripts are in the code respository. These files need to
be set up for the web site to work.  (All paths are within the main
feba/ directory of the repository)

A SQL database using mysqlite, which is in
	cgi_data/feba.db

BLAST executables (blastall, fastacmd, formatdb), which should be in
	bin/blast/
(or this can be a symlink to a location where they are available)

A BLAST database of amino acid sequences, which is in
	cgi_data/aaseqs
and must be formatted with
	bin/formatdb -o T -p T -d cgi_data/aaseqs

Some of the scripts also write temporary files to
	tmp/
This directory will need to be writable by the web server, i.e.,
	chmod a+w tmp

The other dependencies are perl modules:
	CGI
	DBI
	List::Util;
	Time::HiRes (for making unique file names)
	Bio::SeqIO (used to read FASTA files)

P.S. the front page for the web site is:
	cgi/myFrontPage.cgi
