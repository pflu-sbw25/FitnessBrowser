Only the cgi scripts are in the code respository. These other files
will need to be set up for the web site to work.  (All paths are
within the main feba/ directory of the repository)

A SQL database using mysqlite, which is in
	cgi_data/feba.db
Its schema is described in lib/db_setup_tables.sql
It can built from the HTML directories that are created by BarSeqR.pl
by using bin/db_setup.pl. This also requires
   all-vs-all best hits, see MakeBBH.pl
   KEGG best hits, see KeggBestHit.pl
   SwissProt best hits, see SprotBestHit.pl
   SEED annotations (g/*/seedanno.tab, see db_setup_SEED.pl)
	 As well as SEED subsystems from ftp://ftp.theseed.org/subsystems/subsys.txt
   img.xrefs, see bin/IMGXRefs.pl
   the kegg tables, see ../kegg/
   (And kegg/maps/ will be needed for the maps to actually work, see kegg/README)

BLAST executables (blastall, fastacmd, formatdb), which should be in
	bin/blast/
(or this can be a symlink to a location where they are available)

A BLAST database of amino acid sequences, with identifiers of the form orgId:locusId (i.e., "Keio:14146"), in
	cgi_data/aaseqs
It must be formatted with
	bin/blast/formatdb -o T -p T -i cgi_data/aaseqs

Some of the scripts also write temporary files to
	tmp/
This directory will need to be writable by the web server, i.e.,
	chmod a+w tmp

The other dependencies are perl modules:
	CGI
	DBI
        File::Which
        FindBin
        Getopt::Long
	List::Util
        HTML::Entities
        URI::Encode
	Time::HiRes (for making unique file names, and for timing some cgi's with debug=1)
	Bio::SeqIO (used to read FASTA files; could be replaced)
        Digest::MD5 (required for blatch Fitness Blast only)

The front page for the web site is:
	cgi/myFrontPage.cgi

You can modify the text at the top of the home page by creating a file
named "motd" (message of the day) in the main directory (the directory
the contains cgi/).

If setting up fitness blast -- see images/fitblast_example.html,
cgi/seqservice.cgi, and bin/start_ublast_service.pl. You'll need to
create bin/usearch6. Also, images/fitblast.js uses URLs of the form
server_root/cgi-bin/, not server_root/cgi/. You may need to set up
cgi-bin as a symbolic link for it to work, i.e. in the feba directory,
	ln -s cgi cgi-bin

If setting up batch blast, then you need to create a job_data
directory (within the main feba/ directory) and make it writable by
your web server. You'll also need to create bin/usearch (tested with
usearch 8, *not* usearch 6).
